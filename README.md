## OpenList-Backend
This repository will contain the Go implementation for the OpenList backend. The intention of OpenList is as a learning experience for myself with a generally useful project to be formed in the process. 

The end goal for this project is to create a repo which anybody can fork or clone and put up on any service which supports docker ie Now-CLI, AWS, Vultr, ect. and have their own local list manager. The UI for this lives [here](https://github.com/NickLewanowicz/OpenList-app) as a react native application and there will be a desktop web app made in react but there is no projected timeline for completion for those.

See `Projects` tab for activity and goals with this project!
